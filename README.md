# Dictionary Implementation using Trie Data Structure

## Introduction

This is a simple console-based implementation of a Dictionary in Trie Data Structure. I have used a dataset of about 130,000 words which contains the Word, its meaning and its part of speech. The dataset is available here as synonyms.csv. 

## Dataset

The dataset is taken from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bATg0wUKU3aRIO3uHRe31IgV2cd7GDIh).
